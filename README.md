# MAT328-PROJECTPART1

Hello Welcome to My MAT 328 Project. I have  submitted pdf versions of my jupyter hub files for my fist milestones as Single and multiple variable points. For the Milestone 2 I labeled my Jupyter Files by the Variable I used  to compare  the different Classifier I used which are the Decison Trees and K-Nearest NEighbor. In addition the csv file of the twitch data is present. 


*** Update

I have updated the branches and have categorized based on each milestone. This is just done for organizational purposes.

Thats All.
